# get-niji-sign-npm-package
This is a npm package to wrap your given string with -niji- sign.
# what does this package do
It is a simple javascript function which takes your custom string as a parameter and returns it by adding my -niji- sign at the end of your custom string.
# Why did i create it
This package created to demonstrate how to create and publish NPM package on your own. But this code is open for everyone to add there own pretty signs. I invite all the javascript fans to add there signs to the return string.
